"""Bug reports from the site: store them privately, tell the operator they exist.

🚨 THE REPORT AND THE ALERT ARE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED.
A screenshot from somebody struggling with SparrowMap very often contains the
thing they were struggling WITH: their camera key, the QR that IS their camera
key, a reviewer token, or the street outside their window. They sent it to get
help, not to publish it.

The operator's alert channel is a GitHub issue, and ALERT_REPO defaults to the
PUBLIC code repository. So the alert carries an id, a page and a timestamp -
never the description, never the image. The content is read on an
operator-authenticated page. That split is the whole design; everything else
here is bookkeeping.

⚠️ THIS IS AN UNAUTHENTICATED UPLOAD ENDPOINT, which is a thing worth being
nervous about on a 3 GB box. Hence: a size cap enforced before anything is
decoded, a re-encode through Pillow that strips EXIF (a phone screenshot can
carry a GPS fix), a per-hour cap on how many reports exist at all, and a TTL
sweep so an unattended box cannot fill its disk with other people's pictures.

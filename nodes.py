"""SparrowMap - node identity and enrollment.

A node is somebody's camera on somebody's porch. The hub needs to know that a
sighting claiming to come from "Maple St" really did, because a network that
accepts unsigned reports can be flooded with invented ones - and an invented
sighting placing a named vehicle at a named place at a named time is a very
effective way to hurt someone.

So each node holds an ed25519 private key that never leaves the device, and
signs every event. The hub stores only the public half. This also means the hub
operator cannot forge a node's reports, which matters for a network whose whole
premise is not trusting whoever holds the database.

    #
    # ⚠️ ONLY A FIXED CAMERA HAS A WATCHED SPAN, and the test used to be
    # `kind != "mobile"` - which let a PHONE through, because a phone enrolls as
    # kind='phone'. Two of his did, and each got an 80 m line of imaginary road
    # running due north, because a phone has no aim to snap and `heading`
    # defaults to 0. The map then drew a confident wedge onto a road that does
    # not exist. A phone is carried, points wherever its owner is standing, and
    # its sightings carry their own GPS - so it gets no span at all.
    #
    # Allow-list rather than deny-list: a new kind added later defaults to
    # having no span, which is the safe direction. Publishing nothing is
    # recoverable; publishing a fabricated road is not.
    # 🚨 A SPAN REQUIRES A REAL AIM, NOT A SELF-DECLARED `kind`.
    #
    # This used to trust the client's `kind` alone, and the unified camera app
    # sends kind='fixed' for every device - so four phones enrolled through it
    # each got an 80 m line of imaginary road running DUE NORTH, because a
    # browser reports heading=0 when it has no compass fix. The map then drew a
    # confident wedge onto a road that does not exist. That is the same
    # fabricated-span bug as before, arriving from the other direction: last
    # time the server's test was wrong, this time the client's claim was.
    #
    # So the gate is now the thing a span actually depends on: did anybody
    # AIM this camera. A browser only reports a heading while the device is
    # MOVING, so an enrolment from a window never has one - and a node with no
    # aim gets no span until its owner points it on the placement page.
    #
    # Publishing nothing is recoverable. Publishing a fabricated road is not.
    #
    # 🔁 REVISED: "no span" turned out not to mean "publish nothing" - it meant
    # fall through to pushing a point out along heading 0, i.e. due north of the
    # camera, which put contributors' sightings on buildings. That is a
    # fabricated position with no road attached, which is the worse half of both
    # options. So an unaimed FIXED camera now snaps to the nearest real road
    # (road.span_nearest), which claims less than an aimed span and is true.
    #
    # 🚨 THE LINE IS CARRIED-vs-STATIONARY, NOT PHONE-vs-FIXED.
    #
    # This used to span only kind='fixed', on the reasoning that "a phone is
    # carried, so there is no stretch of road it watches, and its sightings
    # carry their own GPS instead". The first half is true of a phone in a
    # POCKET. The second half is not true of the thing this project actually
    # asks people to do: a phone propped in a window is stationary, watches one
    # street, and sends no per-sighting GPS at all - so with no span its
    # sightings fall back to a single invented point and stack there for ever.
    # That was the "dot in the park with thousands of passes behind it".
    #
    # So everything gets a span EXCEPT kind='mobile', which is the one that is
    # genuinely carried: driving mode, whose sightings do carry their own GPS
    # and for which a fixed watched road is a false claim about a street.
    # 🚨 A PUBLIC TRAFFIC CAMERA GETS NO SPAN EITHER, FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON.
    #
    # A span exists to publish the ROAD a camera watches while withholding the
    # HOUSE it sits in. A government traffic camera has no house to protect:
    # the transport authority publishes its exact coordinates, SparrowMap
    # passes them straight through, and the transparency page says so. There is
    # nothing left for a span to hide.
    #
    # It is also what makes scale possible. road.resolve() is an Overpass query
    # per camera, and these arrive in thousands - Finland alone is 2,160. That
    # is thousands of requests to somebody else's free service to compute a
    # privacy screen for a camera whose position is already public. The
    # sightings carry the camera's own published position, which is the honest
    # thing to draw anyway.

    # ⚠️ EVERY node gets a token, not just phones.
    #
    # Originally only kind='phone' got one, on the reasoning that fixed nodes
    # would hold an ed25519 key. In practice the placement page enrols a fixed
    # node with no key, and the ingest path only checks a token IF one exists -
    # so that node could be posted to by anyone on the network with no

    # the code says so.

    being stored at the node's TRUE lat/lon, and /api/sightings serves those
    coordinates to anybody. Reading one sighting gave you the exact camera

    of the cone it was being added to. Every dot sat in whatever back garden

    # worse than it looks. A browser enrolment reports NO heading, so `hdg` is
    # 0 and every sighting from the node is pushed the same distance DUE NORTH
    # of the same jittered point - so they do not merely land off the road,
    # they all land on ONE invented point, stacked, forever. On the live map
    # that is a single dot sitting in a park with dozens of passes behind it.
    #
    # road.py already named this exact failure in span_nearest's docstring and
    # fixed it for nodes that HAVE a span. Most nodes do not: they enrolled
    # from a window with no heading, so the span was never computed and this
    # branch runs every time.
    #
    # Snapping here is the safety net. The real repair is giving the node a
    # span (tools/resnap_nodes.py), which also re-places its stored history;
    # this makes the fallback tolerable in the meantime and for any node that
    # enrols while the road lookup is down.

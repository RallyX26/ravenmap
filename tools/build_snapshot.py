"""Bake the map's opening view into one cacheable file.

    python tools/build_snapshot.py          # writes public/static/snapshot.json

🚨 WHY. Every visitor currently waits on TWO live API calls before a single dot
appears - measured 57.8 KB and 175.5 KB, about 0.7s - and both answer
`cache-control: max-age=4` with `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`, so the edge caches
neither. Thousands of viewers are thousands of database queries for an answer
that is identical for all of them, and the visitor stares at an empty map while
it happens.

A snapshot is a static file under /static/, which the edge DOES cache, so the
first paint costs one cached fetch and no origin work at all.

🚨 IT GOES THROUGH THE SAME REDACTION AS THE API, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE RISK.
This file bypasses the request path, so every guard living in that path would be
bypassed with it - private plate text, the per-day node alias, private
photographs. It calls privacy.redact with viewer="anon", exactly as
hub._public_rows does. ⚠️ If a new rule is ever added to the read path, it has
to be added there and NOT here, or the two will drift and the static copy will
be the one that leaks.

⚠️ AND IT IS LABELLED STALE, BECAUSE IT IS.
The file carries the moment it was built. The map draws it immediately, then
replaces it the instant live data lands, and does not claim to be live until
that happens. A stale snapshot presented as live would be the project telling a
small lie on its own front page every few minutes.

"""Resolve the road cells the box needs, here, and copy them to the box.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Road snapping needs Overpass, and Overpass answers this machine while refusing
the public box. Measured 2026-08-19: overpass-api.de returns roads here in
1.8-3.2s, and from the box the same request gets `Connection refused` on both
IPv4 and IPv6 - ICMP to it succeeds at 25ms and github/openstreetmap/cloudflare
all return 200 from there, so it is them refusing that host, almost certainly
because it sits in a Hetzner range.

The only public instance that DID answer the box was maps.mail.ru, and buying
snapping with it meant telling a large Russian service which ~400 m squares a
project that tracks police vehicles keeps asking about. This file is the reason
that trade is not necessary: the cells get resolved on the machine Overpass is
willing to talk to, and copied to the one that needs them.

🚨 NOTHING NEW IS DISCLOSED BY MOVING THE WORK. The query is the same
grid-snapped bbox road.py already sends - never a camera's true position, which
is what GRID_DEG exists for. Only the machine doing the asking changes.

⚠️ OVERPASS RATE LIMITS HARD, and politeness here is not optional - a sweep of
18 nodes earned a 429 in under two minutes. So this sleeps between queries,
stops on the first sustained refusal, and is meant to be run on a timer with a
small --limit rather than as a backfill of everything at once. The box needs
about 350 new cells a day; a handful per run keeps up easily.

"""Is what is RUNNING the code that is on disk?

2026-08-10. A classifier fix was shipped, the camera node was restarted, and
the node kept running the old code anyway. The launcher has a single-instance
guard: a second detector for the same node refuses to start and says so, then
pauses. If you do not read that window you have a new terminal open, an old
process still running, and every reason to believe the fix is live.

Nothing was broken. The restart simply did not happen, and there was no way to
tell by looking at the map - a stale detector behaves exactly like a fresh one
until it hits the code you changed.

So this compares process start times against source modification times, which
is the one comparison that cannot be fooled by a window that looks right. It is
the same discipline as the rest of this codebase: measure the thing, do not
infer it from something adjacent.

    python tools\\check_running_code.py

Exit code is 1 if anything is stale, so it can gate a deploy step.
